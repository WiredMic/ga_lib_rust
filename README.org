#+title: Geometric Algebra Library in Rust

This is a geometric algebra library written in Rust.

It is made for 3 dimensions.

It will later be used in a Rotor Extended Kalman Filter.

* 3D VGA
It has implemented a full 3D Vector Geometric Algebra.
** Features
- addition, subtraction, inner product, exterior product, geometric product: interaction between all grades
- Rotations for all grades through Rotors
- Projection between all grades
- Rejections between all grades
- Reflection between all grades



* TODO
- I need to make a test for everything
- Do scalars need their own type?
